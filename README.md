# SocketProgrammingProject

Socket Programming Project
This project is a basic implementation of a client-server application using Java's socket programming. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of network communication, including TCP connections, client-server interactions, and message passing.
Features:
User Authentication: The server authenticates clients based on predefined usernames and passwords.
Interactive Menu: Once authenticated, clients can interact with the server through a menu-driven interface.
Get User List: Clients can request a list of all registered users.
Send Messages: Clients can send messages to other registered users.
Get Messages: Clients can retrieve their messages stored on the server.
Exit: Clients can disconnect from the server gracefully.
Multi-client Support: The server can handle multiple clients concurrently, ensuring each client has an independent session.
Message Storage: Messages sent between users are stored on the server and can be retrieved by the recipient at any time.
Technologies Used:
Java: The primary programming language for implementing both the client and server applications.
TCP/IP: The protocol used for reliable communication between the client and server.
Use Case:
This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the basics of socket programming and can be extended to build more complex networked applications. It is ideal for students and developers who are new to network programming and wish to gain hands-on experience with client-server architecture.
